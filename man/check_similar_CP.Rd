\usage{
check_similar_CP(Six_Series, main_cp, nearby_cp_one, threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{Six_Series}{A data frame contains 6 time series differences (so 7 columns
in total) between a main station and a nearby station. The first column should
be the date (in Date type on this format: "\%Y-\%m-\%d"), and the next six columns
must be in this order:
G-E, G-G', G-E', E-E', G'-E', G'-E.}

\item{main_cp}{A vector of main station breakpoints in Date type on this format:
"\%Y-\%m-\%d".}

\item{nearby_cp_one}{A vector of main station breakpoints in Date type on this format:
"\%Y-\%m-\%d".}

\item{threshold}{Integer number is the threshold to define the number of
point between 2 breakpoints in a cluster}
}
\value{
list of main changes and their similar in the nearby in Date type
}
